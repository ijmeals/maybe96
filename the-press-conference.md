# protect the animals

the problem i have with the zoo and other zoo like places,

sea world being an instance of the other category,

there is no question and answer time with the animals themselves;

referring to the non-homos.


am i to reason those are the same voices used by them

when they, the non-homosapiens, made the choice and decision

to be present at the zoo or other zoo-like places when i visit?


why don't they talk?
