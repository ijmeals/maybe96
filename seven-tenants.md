(0) humility (self realization before all else in thinking; then, requires faith)

(a) truth

(b) transparency

(c) sincerity

(d) appreciation 

(e) altruistic 

(f) reasonable 

(g) consideration but that's slippery slope if for not other reason than risk of normalization of an unwanted whatever

(h) practical
