# the convo

all day

it's been

i would say

at best

well ok

now

welcome

faces

tho if mac isn't in your top 5

like he is mine

you aren't a racist

just means you can't relate 

or simply not your taste

these are my two cents

my truest sense

i could share through the fence

while thinking

what if they could write

too

talking about non-homos

like ones you might see in the zoo

what are they thinking

is it a concept

their feelings

perhaps it's about you

and if they shared

wouldn't that be

at least

just maybe

semi-cool
