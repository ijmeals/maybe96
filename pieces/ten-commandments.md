# ten commandments

why not collapse _respect_ thy mother and father to _respect_ all people and then we have an extra commandment

and it would be more welcoming or respect thy parents and what is the difference between respect and honor

the word mother and father; is that the biological mother, the other mother, in some cases both, thinking adoption

also why not every day as a holy day; is it the concern of normalization and do we all not covet something

personally, god, i find the most well known ten commandments to be a bit dated at best

highly inefficient at worst and possibly entirely self serving on the part of the authors, possibly

_not sure if the blanket statement tho shall not covet is practical or every life is lived wrong_

_did i not yearn for cherry or to be a lead before i ever experienced it and should i not have coveted_

_those things in this world or god did you only mean other peoples' significant others in that regard_
