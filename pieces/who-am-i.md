# who am i

ever wonder

what you are

beneath it all

surrounded by stars

no matter how fast one goes

never seeming to really

get that far

<!-- technically you do go far but the appearance may deceive the eye; should be get but go flows better you know -->

everything so spaced out

<!-- what is the formula used to determine the positioning of an element in space regardless of time [bow maybe] -->

like me

how truly bizarre
