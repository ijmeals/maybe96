# a slippery slope

started smoking a little

then i was smoking a lot

thank god it was not crack

it was the pot

tho sometimes it's ok

to sprinkle a bit on top

adding some snow

which can also be coke

back in the day

that is what we meant

when we would say

it's time to hit the slopes

do it too much

and you can end up broke
