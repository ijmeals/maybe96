_planning on asking god when we meet_

1. why a son and not a daughter?

2. why did you not create a father after creating thyself if you created me - where did the idea of father, us and the earthly lifestyle come from?

3. would jesus be in the right to not pay for damage done to the table despite whether it was or was not an absurd thing to do in the temple or on the grounds of the temple?

4. why engulf the earth in flames intentionally? i would think it takes more time to repair afterwards, and isn't a flood still the cleanest method known so far.

5. how do you control what we see; if it is something you can control, do you know what i mean? if not why can you not control it? is god forced to not intervene because of free will or because god agrees with what you see and expierence in the moment?

6. does god have a penis or not, if god is a guy or is difference between He and male (always a possibility)

7. why didn't jesus turn himself in to the roman authorities
