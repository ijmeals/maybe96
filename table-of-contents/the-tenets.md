# the tenets

(0) humility (self realization before all else in thinking; then, requires faith)

(a) truth

(b) transparency

(c) sincerity

(d) appreciation 

(e) altruistic 

(f) reasonable 

(g) consideration but that's slippery slope if for not other reason than risk of normalization of an unwanted whatever

(h) practical

(10) consistency in following tenets

all standalone things, i think

from there other things can be derived or built upon

like accountability comes from a and b at the very least

_would it be more appealing if i titled it ten ants and used ants instead for the bullet point symbol_
