# was it just a dream

you know how i know i am not the dream weaver

if i was the dreamer i would of dreamt of something better

at least for myself

the world at large statistically is a lot better off

for that i am thankful and grateful

_in an existence without a god, this here is phenomenal_

am i lucky or am i blessed

all i know

so is everyone else
