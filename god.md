# god

_through god i feel all things; through god i see all things_

not sure; who do you pray to?

how would you describe that god?

we can make believe and i can substitutes yours for mine

and say that is god if it makes you happy

tho i am not sure we are advance enough to answer or know

who is the truest of all gods; at best we know our god

## is there a god

of course, of course

you think you created this

eventually something came from

well, nothing, right

that nothing could be view as something

possibly god; so is there a god

and a solution to how something comes from nothing

when in reality it was something which came from something

_see how useless this theoretical stuff is, at the very least arguably impractical_

<!-- those hard

those hot

hot hot bars

it's either me or

some superstar -->

### what if, tho

the question with god is often tied or associated to the idea that life goes on, that something of you transcends this.

if that is thy concern, this sphere, plane, universe seems well designed so we are firmly in the belief this here could be luck or

something more beautiful at work.
