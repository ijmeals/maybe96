# god

_through god i feel all things; through god i see all things_

not sure; who do you pray to?

how would you describe that god?

we can make believe and i can substitutes yours for mine

and say that is god if it makes you happy

tho i am not sure we are advance enough to answer or know

who is the truest of all gods; at best we know our god

## is there a god

of course, of course

you think you created this

those hard

those hot

hot hot bars

it's either me or

some superstar
