why no practical guide to creating your own framework 

instead of always having to rely on someone else's thinking

and preferences


one language is no better universally than any other, some are however

better for certain jobs or task than others though you cannot have this world

without the other languages even if you personally only prefer to work or use or apply

a certain one


the most dangerous type of engineer, preacher, or any homosapien is the person who thinks

they know, there way is the best and if at the very least admits their way may not be correct yet

insist their thinking should lead the pack; hence, humility.
